     <h1 class="bodyhead">Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
     <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
        holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my 
        favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
     </p>
     <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween
        pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will 
        keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
